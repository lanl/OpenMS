This is a collection of solvers, including mean-field and many-body methods,
for solving the molecular quantum electrodynamics (mQED) Hamiltonian.

:mod:`mqed.qedhf`: **QED-HF**
  Basic QED Hartree-Fock (HF) method. Converged non-QED/HF calculation
  is used to compute QED dipole self-energy (DSE) mediated contributions.

:mod:`mqed.scqedhf`: **SC-QED-HF**
  Strongly-coupled QED-HF method. Polaron transformation is performed for
  all photon modes, the DSE contributions and molecular orbitals are
  self-consistently updated.

:mod:`mqed.vtqedhf`: **VT-QED-HF**
  Variational transformation QED-HF method. The degree of the polaron
  transformation is variationally-optimized for each photon mode to
  handle all coupling strengths.
