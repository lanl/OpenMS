This folder implements the models for electronic structure, including:

1) Nearest TB:

.. math::

   H0 = \sum_j \epsilon_j c^\dagger_j c_j - t \sum_{j}(c^\dagger_{j+1}c_j + h.c.)

2) Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH):

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   H &= H0 + H_{int} + H_{ph} &\\
   H_{ph} &=  &\\
   H_{int} &= &
   \end{align*}

3) Hubbard-Holstein model (HHM):

.. math::

   H = -t \sum_{js} (c^\dagger_{j+1,s} c_{j,s}+ hc) + U\sum_j n_{ju} n_{jd} \\
   + g\sum_{js} (b^\dagger_j + b_j) n_{j,\sigma} + omega\sum_j b^\dagger_j b_j.

or

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   H &= H0 + H_U + H_{int} + H_{ph}, &\\
   H_U &= U\sum_j n_{ju} n_{jd} &\\
   H_{int} &= g\sum_{js} (b^\dagger_j + b_j) n_{j,\sigma} &\\
   H_{ph}&= \omega\sum_j b^\dagger_j b_j. &
   \end{align*}

where :math:`s` denotes spin DOF and :math:`n_j = c^\dagger_j c_j`.

4) Disordered model for molecular aggregates:

.. math::

   H = \sum_j (\epsilon+\Delta_j) c^\dagger_j c_j - \sum_j (t+\Gamma_j) c^\dagger_j c_j.

where :math:`\Delta_j` and :math:`\Gamma_j` are random variables.

5) Shin-Metiu Model

.. math::

   H =
